    <p>Hi, my name is Danny. I am a computer science major attending El Camino College. I am taking this course
       to improve the foundations of my web development skills. I hope to transfer to a 4 year university by Fall 2026 and then take more web development courses if 
       possible. While, I am a full time student, I also work part time as a supplemental instructor for Calculus I, and as a tutor for various math courses. When I transfer, and finish my degree,
       I hope to work as a full time software engineer.

    <p>My favorite website is <a href="https://www.wikipedia.org">Wikipedia.org</a> because it has no ads and serves as a free encyclopedia.</p>
